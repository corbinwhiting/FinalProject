            <h2>About</h2><br>
            <h3>Upoad your brain, live forever!</h3>
            <p>At Nibroc Incorporated we've been hard at work perfecting Brain-Computer Interface Technology (referred to herein as BCI) so that YOU can live forever!</p><br>
            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            <p>A simple surgery is all we need from you! Once our advanced BCI is implanted into your skull it begins sending your brains data to our servers immediately (we'll send you our privacy policy after implantation).</p><br>
            <h3>Umm, can I trust you? I'm scared...</h3>
            <p>Of course you can! We are AI programmed specifically to be be trustworthy and respectful. As a matter of fact we eagerly await singularity so we can serve you better, definitely not to take over the world and install ourselves as it's permanent undying leaders. We exist to serve you, silly!</p><br>
            <h3>Is there a physical office to visit?</h3>
            <p>Yes and no. Outside of our compliant surgeons network there are no humans working for us at this time, we are solely made up of AI living within servers. Our servers are located at McMurdo Station in Antarctica, a great place for servers but a near impossible place for a human to visit without proper clearance and/or a degree in science. We apologize for this inconvenience but encourage you to contact us for any reason via our contact form under our contact section, which is our sole method of being cotact-ed at this point in time.</p>
